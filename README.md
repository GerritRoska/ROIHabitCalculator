# 💰 ROI Habit Calculator

Ever wondered how much your habits are costing you in long-term wealth?

The **ROI Habit Calculator** is a fun, interactive tool that helps you visualize the financial future of your daily and weekly decisions — like skipping takeout, canceling unused subscriptions, or brewing coffee at home.

Instead of just showing “what you save,” it shows **what you could grow** — using compound interest over time.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

After seeing how small daily spending adds up (e.g., $5/day = $260,000+ over 40 years), I wanted to help others visualize it too — not just in terms of “savings,” but in **true opportunity cost**.

With inspiration from behavioral economics, investment compounding, and AI-driven workflows — this project was born.
