üîß Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Locate or Create the public/ Folder
In your Replit file structure:

If you already have a public/ folder ‚Üí use it.

If not ‚Üí create a folder named exactly:
public

This folder is exposed as the root of your deployed site. So anything inside it will be available like https://your-site.com/social-preview.png.

2. Upload the Preview Image
You now have a working image (we generated it earlier). Here's what to do:

Save that image to your computer (if you haven't already).

Drag it into the public/ folder in your Replit project.

Name it:
social-preview.png

3. Update Your Meta Tags
In your index.html (or wherever your <head> is), use this cleaned-up version:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Primary Meta Tags -->
<title>Habit ROI Calculator ‚Äì Turn Coffee Into $1M</title>
<meta name="title" content="Habit ROI Calculator ‚Äì Turn Coffee Into $1M">
<meta name="description" content="See how your small habits (like coffee) could grow into real wealth over time.">

<!-- Open Graph / Facebook -->
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://replit.com/@gerritroska/ROIHabitCalculator">
<meta property="og:title" content="Habit ROI Calculator ‚Äì Turn Coffee Into $1M">
<meta property="og:description" content="See how your small habits (like coffee) could grow into real wealth over time.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://replit.com/@gerritroska/ROIHabitCalculator/public/social-preview.png">

<!-- Twitter -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Habit ROI Calculator ‚Äì Turn Coffee Into $1M">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="See how your small habits (like coffee) could grow into real wealth over time.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://replit.com/@gerritroska/ROIHabitCalculator/public/social-preview.png">
4. Redeploy or Refresh Your Replit App
Just running the app in Replit may not be enough ‚Äî make sure your project is publicly accessible:

Try visiting the Replit-hosted preview link directly.

Ensure the image URL works like this:
https://replit.com/@gerritroska/ROIHabitCalculator/public/social-preview.png

‚ö†Ô∏è If that URL still gives a 404: You likely need to expose the public/ folder through your Vite/Express config. Let me know if you need help with that!

5. Test the Preview
Use:

LinkedIn Post Inspector

Twitter Card Validator

Paste your project URL and confirm the image shows up.
