Please update the dynamic Acorns CTA block to:

---

✅ 1. Only display **after** results are calculated and below the “Investment Summary” section.

---

✅ 2. Always display **only one CTA block**, even if multiple habits are active.

---

✅ 3. Generate dynamic CTA text as follows:

### A) If ONLY ONE habit is active:
- Calculate total cost for the period:
  cost = `costPerUse × timesPerPeriod`
- Correctly reflect the actual frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Use the correct singular **habit name** (not pluralized)
- Example output:

💡 Your $15/week eating out habit could become $89,000
Acorns helps you invest that amount automatically — and grow it over time.

- Use the habit name the user selected/inputted — not always “coffee”

---

### B) If “Combine Multiple Weaknesses” is enabled and multiple habits are active:

- Instead of listing all habit names and frequencies (too long), summarize them.
- Calculate the **combined spending per month or per year**:
- Use per year if > $1,000/year
- Use per month if under that

- Example output:
🧠 Your combined habits (~$280/month) could grow to $520,000
Acorns helps you invest that amount automatically — and grow it over time.

- Add an **optional emotional line** above the headline:
- For example:
  - “This isn’t just spare change — it’s your future working for you.”
  - “Small choices add up. What could yours become?”
  - “You're already halfway to building wealth. Now automate it.”

---

✅ 4. Subtext under the headline should always be:
Acorns helps you invest that amount automatically — and grow it over time.

✅ 5. Below this text, insert the CTA button:
- Label: “🌱 Start Investing with Acorns →”
- URL: `https://www.acorns.com/share/?first_name=Gerrit&shareable_code=QM3PVD3`
- Styling:
  - Green background (#1DB954)
  - White text
  - Rounded corners
  - Bold
  - Center aligned

---

✅ 6. CTA Container Styling:

Apply these styles to the entire CTA block container:

```css
border-radius: 12px;
background-color: #e8fbe7;
padding: 32px 24px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
text-align: center;
transition: all 0.3s ease;
max-width: 700px;
margin: 40px auto;
If possible, include a fade-in effect when it first appears.

✅ 7. Fix frequency-related math and grammar issues:

Make sure:

Weekly habits (e.g., 2× at $5) show as $10/week — not $5/week

Monthly habits (e.g., 4× per month at $12) show as $48/month

Daily habits multiply correctly

The habit name is inserted dynamically, and does not default to "coffee" or "coffees"
