Subject:
Social Share Preview Image (og:image) Not Displaying When Deployed via Replit

Description:
I have correctly set up my HTML meta tags for Open Graph and Twitter social sharing, including an og:image tag pointing to a public image (for use on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and iMessage). This works perfectly when deployed on Netlify or similar static hosts. However, when I deploy my app on Replit, social platforms do not show the preview image (even though the tags are present and correct).

Technical Details:

My <head> contains meta tags like:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta property="og:image" content="https://[my-replit-url]/social-preview.png">
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
The image is present in the public/ directory of my Replit project and accessible at
https://[my-replit-url]/social-preview.png

The Problem:

When sharing the site link, no image preview appears on social platforms or messaging apps (LinkedIn, Twitter, iMessage, Facebook, etc.).

I confirmed that:

The image URL loads in my browser.

The meta tags are correct and in the <head>.

The same setup works when deployed to Netlify.

But link previews still fail on Replit deployments.

Suspected Cause:

It appears that Replitâ€™s hosting does not serve static files in a way that allows social media crawlers/bots (such as Facebookâ€™s or LinkedInâ€™s) to fetch the image, even if the file is technically reachable in a browser.

This could be due to:

Bot/crawler user-agent blocking

Non-standard HTTP headers

Slow response time to crawlers

Image files behind authentication or some middleware

Dynamic routing interfering with file access

What I Need:

Can you confirm whether Replit supports direct, unauthenticated, static file serving for social media link preview crawlers (for both the root URL and files like /social-preview.png)?

If not, is there a documented workaround or hosting configuration I can use to ensure og:image is accessible for social link previews?

Thank you!
Let me know if you need more specifics or a link to my live Replit project.
