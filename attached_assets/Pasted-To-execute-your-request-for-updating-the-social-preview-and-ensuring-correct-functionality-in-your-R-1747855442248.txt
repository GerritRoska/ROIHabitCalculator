To execute your request for updating the social preview and ensuring correct functionality in your Replit project, follow these structured steps:

Step 1: Ensure public/ Folder Exists
Verify that you have a public/ folder in your Replit file structure, as this is essential for hosting static files like images.

Step 2: Upload the Preview Image
Drag and drop the social-preview.png image file into the public/ folder. This image will be accessible via the URL:

https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app/social-preview.png
Step 3: Update Your Meta Tags in index.html
Edit your index.html file to ensure the meta tags correctly reference the image and essential details for social sharing. Use the following cleaned-up version:

<!-- Primary Meta Tags -->
<title>Habit ROI Calculator – Turn Coffee Into $1M</title>
<meta name="title" content="Habit ROI Calculator – Turn Coffee Into $1M">
<meta name="description" content="See how your small habits (like coffee) could grow into real wealth over time.">
<!-- Open Graph / Facebook -->
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app/">
<meta property="og:title" content="Habit ROI Calculator – Turn Coffee Into $1M">
<meta property="og:description" content="See how your small habits (like coffee) could grow into real wealth over time.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app/social-preview.png">
<!-- Twitter -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Habit ROI Calculator – Turn Coffee Into $1M">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="See how your small habits (like coffee) could grow into real wealth over time.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app/social-preview.png">
Step 4: Redeploy Your Replit App
Ensure that your project is publicly accessible and test the URLs:

Visit the Replit-hosted preview link directly.
You may also want to confirm that the image is accessible at:

https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app/social-preview.png
If you receive a 404 error, make sure you’ve followed the public folder structure.

Step 5: Test the Preview
Utilize tools such as:

LinkedIn Post Inspector
Twitter Card Validator
Paste your project URL and confirm the image shows up correctly.
