🌱 ✅ Acorns Integration Strategy — Full Breakdown
🔁 1. Homepage Button (Already Good – Keep It!)
Text:

“Start Investing with Acorns – $5 Bonus”

What to Do:

Keep this high up but not huge

Style: subtle green button (#1DB954), small icon (🌱 or 💰)

Add a tooltip:

“Acorns helps you turn your habit savings into real investments automatically.”

📊 2. Inline Text Under the Final Investment Result
Where:
Right under the “Final Amount” projection (e.g., $196,402)

Text Suggestion:

💡 Want to actually grow this money?
Acorns automatically invests it for you — even if it’s just $5/week.
Try Acorns + get $5 →

Style: smaller font, light gray text with a green accent

Optional: toggle to hide/show if user wants fewer suggestions

📈 3. Add an “Investment Impact” Visualization
Where:
Under “Habit ROI” chart or final summary.

Display:

A bar or chart comparing:

What you saved (e.g., $63K)

What Acorns could turn it into (e.g., $196K)

Label: “Investing with Acorns (7% avg return)”

This gives the "small action, big result" visual punch.

Text Suggestion:

“Investing even small amounts consistently — like $5/day — could turn into $200,000+ over time.”

🧩 4. Footer CTA (Subtle but Persistent)
Where:
At the very bottom of the site, before the copyright.
