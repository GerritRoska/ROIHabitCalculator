🔧 Recommended Improvements for Claude (Replit/Tempo Labs)
1. Add a Call-to-Action Footer Section
Why: Currently the Acorns link appears once and can be easily missed.
What to do:

Add a persistent but non-intrusive footer CTA:

“💸 Ready to turn your habit savings into real investments? Try Acorns + get $5 — it’s what we recommend.”

Place it just above the copyright line.

Please add a subtle footer section with the following centered text, using smaller font and light gray background. Place it just above the copyright:
💸 Ready to turn your habit savings into real investments? 
<a href="https://www.acorns.com/share/?first_name=Gerrit&shareable_code=QM3PVD3" target="_blank">Try Acorns + get $5 — it’s what we recommend</a>
2. Add a Tooltip or Info Icon Explaining Acorns
Why: Subtle education builds trust. Let people know why this tool recommends Acorns.
Where: Next to the “Start Investing with Acorns ($5 Bonus)” button.
What to say:

“Acorns automatically invests your spare change and habit savings into diversified portfolios — perfect for consistent long-term growth.”

Add a small info icon (ℹ️) next to the 'Start Investing with Acorns' button. When hovered or clicked, show this tooltip:
“Acorns automatically invests your spare change and habit savings into diversified portfolios — perfect for consistent long-term growth.”
3. Add Optional Email Capture for Investment Tips
Why: Begin building a user list with minimal effort.
Suggested location: Right after “Investment Summary” or under the final milestone section.
Text idea:

“Want monthly tips on turning your habits into long-term wealth? Drop your email here.”

Add a simple email input field with a button that says 'Send Me Tips'. 
Place it beneath the 'Investment Summary' section, styled to match the app. No popups or required submission — optional only.
4. Dark Mode Toggle (Optional but Nice)
Why: UX bonus, especially for mobile and night readers.

Add a light/dark mode toggle switch at the top right near the share icon. Use local storage to remember the user’s preference.
5. Make ROI Results Sharable
Why: Boosts virality. Let users share their result summary.
Where: Under the “Final Amount” card or beside the export summary button.
Claude prompt:

Add a 'Share My Results' button next to the 'Export Summary' button. When clicked, generate a short URL (or allow them to copy a formatted summary like: "I saved $63K and earned $196K by skipping coffee for 35 years — try it yourself!") with a link back to the app.
