Great question — let’s clear it up in simple steps:

✅ What You're Trying to Do:
You want the link to your Netlify site (e.g. https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app) to:

Show a clean, custom preview (image, title, description)

Work automatically when someone shares it on:

LinkedIn

iMessage

Slack

Twitter

etc.

🧠 How Netlify Handles Link Previews
✅ Yes — it will show a preview if:
You’ve added the correct Open Graph metadata to your public/index.html file

Your preview image is publicly accessible (hosted at a real URL like /og-image.jpg)

Once you deploy your project through Netlify, anyone who pastes that link (even in a text message or LinkedIn post) will see the preview — as long as it’s properly set up.

✅ What You Need to Do (Step-by-Step on Netlify)
🔧 STEP 1: Add the Open Graph Tags
In your React project:

Go to your public/index.html file

Inside the <head> section, paste this:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Open Graph (OG) Preview Tags -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Habit ROI Calculator – Turn Coffee Into $1M" />
<meta property="og:description" content="See how your small habits (like coffee) could grow into real wealth over time." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app/og-image.jpg" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
🖼 STEP 2: Add the Image
Upload your image (e.g. og-image.jpg) into your /public folder in your project

That file will be served at:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://roi-habit-calculator.netlify.app/og-image.jpg
You can test it by visiting that link after deploying.

🚀 STEP 3: Deploy to Netlify
If you’ve already connected your GitHub repo to Netlify:

Just push your changes

Netlify will redeploy automatically with the new metadata + image

Or you can drag-and-drop your entire dist/ or build/ folder to the Netlify drop deploy tool.

🧪 STEP 4: Test the Preview
Paste your link into:

https://www.opengraph.xyz/

LinkedIn post editor (you'll see the card generate live)

Twitter card validator: cards-dev.twitter.com/validator

✅ To Your Question: Will It “Automatically Upload”?
No — you have to manually add the tags and image once.

But yes, once deployed on Netlify, the preview will show automatically when shared anywhere — even if someone texts the link.

✅ Summary
You want to do…	Do this on Netlify
Show custom preview on share	Add OG tags in public/index.html
Make sure preview image loads	Place image in /public, link to it
Deploy it	Push to GitHub or drag-drop to Netlify
Preview it	Use LinkedIn or opengraph.xyz
