ere’s how you can clearly communicate your requests:

Remove Self-Promotion Section:
Please remove the section in the code between "Created by Gerrit Roska" and "Inspired by Jack Skywalker's blog" that states "Invest with Acorns". This will make the app feel more neutral and less promotional.

Increase Vertical Spacing:
I would like to create extra vertical spacing between the animated “Share with friends” text and the share icon, as they are currently too close together on mobile.

Add Top Margin:
Additionally, please add more top margin between the share icon/text and the "Habit ROI Calculator" title to improve visibility on smaller screens.

Thanks!

Code Changes Breakdown
Remove Self-Promotion Section: You can remove the following block in your CalculatorPanel.tsx file (as per the indicated section):
<div className="flex items-center gap-1.5">
  <span >
    Invest with Acorns
  </span>
  <a
    href="https://www.acorns.com/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 transition-colors inline-flex items-center"
    aria-label="Invest with Acorns"
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      window.open("https://www.acorns.com/", "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer");
    }}
  >
    <DollarSign className="w-4 h-4" />
  </a>
</div>
Increase Vertical Spacing: Update the py-4 class in the home.tsx file to increase spacing below:
<div className="absolute top-8 right-4 flex items-center gap-2 py-6"> {/* Adjust "py" for more spacing*/}
  <div className="animate-bounce-fade-in opacity-0 animation-delay-500 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    Share with friends! →
  </div>
  <Button variant="ghost" size="icon" onClick={handleShare}>
    <Share2 className="h-5 w-5" />
  </Button>
</div>
Add Top Margin: Lastly, you can modify the margin above the share section in home.tsx:
<div className="container mx-auto py-8 px-4">
  <div className="mt-12"> {/* Additional top margin */}
    ...
  </div>
</div>
These changes should enhance the app's neutrality and improve the user interface on mobile as you requested.
