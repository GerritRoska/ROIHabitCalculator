Please remove the current "Start Investing with Acorns – $5 Bonus" button at the top of the site.

Then, create a new CTA block that appears ONLY after the user has entered their habits and calculated their results.

✅ The CTA block should:
- Be placed directly below the final “Investment Summary” result and **above** the “Your Investment Milestones” section.
- Include **only one CTA button** for Acorns, not multiple.
- Dynamically update its text based on the user’s habit(s), including:
  - The name of the habit
  - The cost per period (day/week/month)
  - The projected investment value

✅ Handle both SINGLE and MULTIPLE habits with dynamic language:

🟦 **If only one habit is being tracked:**
- Show this format:
  💡 "Your $X/period [habit] could become $Y"
- Example:
  💡 "Your $3/day coffee habit could become $196,000"
- Subtext:
  “Acorns helps you invest that amount automatically — and grow it over time.”

🟨 **If 'Combine Multiple Weaknesses' is enabled and multiple habits are active:**
- Show this format:
  🧠 "Your combined $X + $Z habits could grow to $Total"
- Example:
  🧠 "Your combined $3/day + $20/week habits could grow to $293,000"
- Subtext:
  “Turn those small decisions into long-term wealth — Acorns can help.”

✅ Below that dynamic text, insert one single CTA button:
- Label: “🌱 Start Investing with Acorns →”
- Link: https://www.acorns.com/share/?first_name=Gerrit&shareable_code=QM3PVD3
- Style: match current site button styles (rounded, green, white text, no large shadow)

✅ The CTA block must:
- Be hidden (`display: none`) by default
- Appear only after the calculation is done
- Pull from the actual habit data the user entered (cost, frequency, etc.)
- Work on both desktop and mobile layouts

✅ Optional:
- Add a soft fade-in animation when the CTA appears
- Leave the small footer CTA text (“Try Acorns + get $5”) at the bottom as a non-intrusive secondary link

This CTA must feel helpful, not salesy, and must clearly connect the user’s **input and result** with the value of Acorns.
